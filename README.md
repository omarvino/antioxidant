# 🧪 Thermodynamic Descriptor Predictor for Antioxidant Reactivity

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://antioxidant-predict.streamlit.app)

This repository contains the source code for a web application that predicts thermodynamic descriptors (Ionization Potential, Bond Dissociation Energy, and Proton Affinity) for antioxidant reactivities of molecules from their SMILES strings.

The application is built with Streamlit and uses Graph Neural Network (GNN) models developed with PyTorch Lightning and Chemprop.
