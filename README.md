# 🧪 Antioxidant Property Predictor

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)]([LINK-TO-YOUR-DEPLOYED-STREAMLIT-APP])

This repository contains the source code for a web application that predicts antioxidant properties (Ionization Potential, Bond Dissociation Energy, and Proton Affinity) for molecules from their SMILES strings.

The application is built with Streamlit and uses Graph Neural Network (GNN) models developed with PyTorch Lightning and Chemprop.
